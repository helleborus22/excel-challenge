# Excel Challenge
# **Module 1**
This challenge aims to organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects from a dataset created by Trilogy Education Services. 

The following tasks were performed:
- found how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal
- found how much each project backer paid on average
- created a pivot table that analyzed the dataset and showed how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, and/or currently live per category
- created a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country (See Figure 1)
- created a pivot table that analyzed the dataset and showed how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, and/or currently live per sub-category
- created a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category (Figure, 2)
- created a pivot table with a pivot-chart line graph that display the projects by their state and date and can be filtered by parent category and year (Figure, 3)
- found the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per established goal range and created a line chart that graphs the relationship between goal amounts and outcome (figure, 4)

Based on the current analysis, the following three conclusions were determined about crowdfunding campaigns:
- 1: There is a 56.5% success rate
- 2: There is a 36.4% failed rate 
- 3: The most successful is the theater and the least successful is journalism 

The limitations of the dataset to consider are as follows:
- The dataset doesnâ€™t convert the different currency to a primary currency which shows lack of consistency and accuracy. 

Further analysis could create the following:
- A scattered graph that would provide the variance and the standard deviation for a better understanding of volatility;
- A linear relationship to describe the relationship between variables, such as the time of they year and the outcome of the project
